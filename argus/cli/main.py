usage: argus <command> [options]

  setup    acquire and verify everything this machine needs.
           Shows each component's licence and asks BEFORE fetching it, downloads
           anything once, resumes safely, and refuses whatever it cannot verify.

  doctor   check the install and say precisely what is wrong and how to fix it.
           A check that cannot run reports UNKNOWN, never pass.

  demo     a synthetic demonstration. No network, no GPU, about a second.
           Its output is labelled DEMONSTRATION_ONLY by construction.

  run      run the real pipeline on a chosen target.
           Refuses a target it cannot name unambiguously, a machine that cannot
           finish, an input it has not verified, and a volume the model's declared
           provenance policy does not cover.

  start    start the Docker stack (needs Docker Desktop, no Python or Node on the
           host beyond this command) and wait, with a bound, until it is READY.
  stop     stop it; data is kept. `stop --down` removes the containers, never the volumes.
  status   running? ready? which check failed and what to do next. Exit 0 only when READY.

new here?  argus demo     then   argus doctor     then   argus start

operator:  argus identify PATH_OR_URL
           says which official scroll/volume a tifxyz segment, zarr store or volume URL is, from
           its own evidence, with a confidence level, or refuses and says why; then its route.
           argus exposure check|report|graph|validate|resolve ...
           public model-exposure accounting: four channels per (model, physical scroll), an
           evidence graph, VERIFIED/INFERRED/UNVERIFIED claims, fail-closed held-out eligibility.
           argus acquire --dry-run --url ... --scroll ... --volume-id ... --phase A0
           plans an acquisition from local metadata and fetches nothing.
